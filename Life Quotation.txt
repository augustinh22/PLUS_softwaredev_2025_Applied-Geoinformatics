One quotation i like (There is no smoke without fire)
Food i don't like (Beans)
A recommendation (I strongely recommend this book for your reading pleasure'' An enemy called average''  It's a motivational book that challenges readers to break free from mediocrity, unluck their full potential and pursue excellence in all areas of life)
One German word i love so much ''Endshuldigung'' It's a word i use when i want to say Please or Sorry
